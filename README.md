# validateHTMLFiles
This is a program that is written in Python to check if the HTML file is valid or not.Â In HTML, tags exist in both opening and closing forms and must be balanced to properly describe a web document.
If the file is missing one of the opening or closing forms of a tag, then this HTML file is invalid and need some fix.
